Lab 2: iteration to recursion and recursion to iteration exercise
CS105, Haverford College
Due date: September 16, Midnight | submissions would be accepted through GitHub only unless stated otherwise. 

<replace with your name>

Following are the list of tasks that you have to accomplish:

(1)A function named nth_fibonacci_using_recursion() is given in fibonacci.py and works as intended. The implementation has been verified on the relevant test cases provided in test_fibonacci.txt. 

Your job is to implement nth_fibonacci_using_iteration() provided in fibonacci.py such it passes the corresponding test cases provided test_fibonacci.txt. Make sure you use loop constructs instead of recursion.

(2) Similar to (1), sqrt_iterative() placed in square_root.py works as intended. The implementation is verified the relevant test cases provided in test_square_root.txt. 

Your job is to implement sqrt_recursive() provided in square_root.py such it passes the corresponding test cases provided test_square_root.txt. Make sure you use recursion instead of any loop constructs. 

(3) Test your implementations using the following from the Terminal window of PyCharm and make sure it passes all the test cases

(a) python -m doctest -v test_square_root.txt
(b) python -m doctest -v test_fibonacci.txt

(4) Next, commit and push (VCS->Git->Push menu in PyCharm) your code to your GitHub repositoryÂ
